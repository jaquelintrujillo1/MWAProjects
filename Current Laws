Members of the 115th Congress on immigration
March 9, 2017: Politico reported that Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, opposed the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He said, "As far as the wall goes, I believe we have to have border security, but I do think billions of dollars on a wall is not the right way to proceed." He suggested security personnel and an electric fence as possible alternatives to a wall for border security.[151]
March 8, 2017: Members of the House Judiciary Committee indicated that the EB-5 immigrant investor program—which allows individuals who invest $1 million in the U.S. or $500,000 in high unemployment areas to obtain a green card—should be altered or discontinued at the end of April. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) said, "The days of last-minute extensions and continuing resolutions are over. Let me repeat that: No more extensions in CRs." Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) similarly said, "I must reiterate to achieve the necessary reforms to the EB5 programs, there is no substitute to a meaningful legislative solution, and absent significant reform, either regulatory or legislative, I will not be able to support continued authorization of this program." Proposals to modify the program included raising the minimum investment threshold from $500,000 to $1.35 million and narrowing the requirements for what qualifies as a high unemployment area.[152]
February 11, 2017: Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) sent a letter to Trump asking him to issue an order to prevent immigrants residing in the country illegally from benefitting from the child tax credit. Messer said, “Most Americans are astonished to learn that each year billions of taxpayer dollars are given out to people who are in our country illegally. This is just one example of how our broken tax and immigration systems continue to incentivize immigrants to come here illegally. It’s long past time to change it.” In January 2017, Messer introduced HR 363 to "ensure that only taxpayers with a valid Social Security Number are able to claim the Child Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit."[153][154]
February 7, 2017: Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) announced the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, which would reduce legal immigration by 50 percent. The bill would eliminate immigration preferences for certain categories of extended and adult family members, end the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, and limit permanent refugee resettlement to 50,000 individuals per year.[155]
January 30, 2017: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) led a rally, along with other congressional Democrats, in front of the Supreme Court to oppose Trump's executive orders on immigration. "This order is against what we believe in in America. The order will make us unsafe. The order will make us inhumane. And the order will make us less of America because this order is what America is all about. It will make us unsafe because it will encourage those who are lone wolves as they get more and more isolated, which is our greatest danger," Schumer said.[156]
January 29, 2017: U.S. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) issued the following joint statement, in part, in opposition to Trump's executive orders on the refugee admission program and immigration:
“	Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation.
It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.

Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.

Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.[46]

”
—U.S. Sens. John Mcain and Lindsey Graham[157]
November 14, 2016: U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said that he did not believe House Speaker Ryan's immigration policy was "consistent with what is in the best interest of America." Brooks voted to elect Ryan as the speaker of the House in 2015 after Ryan pledged not to introduce any major immigration legislation while President Barack Obama (D) was in office.[158]
November 13, 2016: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said that his immigration focus in the following months would be border security. "We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. ... I think we should put people's minds at ease: That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border. We think that's first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue, we've got to know who's coming and going into the country—we've got to secure the border," Ryan said in an interview on CNN.[159]
November 10, 2016: Kamala Harris (D), who was elected to the U.S. Senate in California on November 8, 2016, called Trump's proposals to construct a wall along the southern border and have Mexico pay for it "absolutely unrealistic." She expressed optimism that a bipartisan agreement on immigration could be reached and noted that she and other Democrats had already discussed "banding together" to oppose Trump's policies
