<ul> 
<li> Show the police your driver's license </li>

political beliefs. </p>
<p> However, law enforcement officers at the airport and at the border generally have the authority to search all bags and to ask you 
questions about your citizenship and travel itinerary, though if you are simply flying domestically (between U.S. cities or states)
it is unusual for officers to ask questions about citizenship status. If you are taken into custody at the airport, you should 
request to speak with an attorney, not sign any papers, and remain silent.
It is important that you only attempt to fly if you have a valid (unexpired) state or federal ID. Some forms of ID that are 
accepted by TSA are: state-issued driver’s license, state ID, passport from your country of origin, or a DACA EAD card.
