<h1> Everyone in the U.S has rights guaranteed under the U.S Constitution, regardless of immigration status. Understanding these 
rights will help you advocate and respond correctly to any police or immigration enforcement, for yourself and for others </h1>


Your Rights Inside of Your Home
In any interaction with law or immigration enforcement, the most important practices to remember are:

Stay calm
Stay silent (don’t mention where you were born or how you entered the US)
Record details and names
Do NOT run away
Ask to speak to your lawyer before signing any documents or answering any questions
If you do speak, do not lie.
Your home carries with it special protections that public spaces do not. Understanding what those are (and aren’t) can help you 
navigate stressful encounters with immigration enforcement on your doorstep, and potentially avoid harm.

If ICE knocks on the front door of your home or apartment and asks to enter, do not open the door. ICE is only allowed to enter if 
they have a valid judicial search or arrest warrant with your correct name and/or address, signed by a judge.

Ask the officer to slip the warrant under the door or hold it up to your front window so you can examine it. ICE will usually have 
a warrant of deportation or removal, which is signed by an immigration official, not a judge, and does NOT give them permission to 
enter the home even if you or another occupant’s name is on it, unless you give them permission. If this is the only warrant they 
provide, you should NOT open the door.

Although opening the door does not mean that you are giving them permission to enter our home, officers may say later that you did.  

If the officer refuses to show you their warrant, tell them that because they have not demonstrated that they have a valid warrant, 
you are exercising your constitutional right and will not open the door to them.

 In order for a search warrant to be valid, it must meet the following criteria:

Must be signed by a judge – NOT an immigration official
Must contain the address of the home to be searched
Must describe the area to be searched
You have the same rights in an apartment as you do in a house. ICE cannot force a landlord to open your front door if you refuse 
because they do not have a valid warrant.

Stay calm and call an attorney right away.
Don’t say anything to them except “I have the right to remain silent.”
Do not sign any papers. You do not have to sign anything without your lawyer there.
Record the incident on a phone or camera, and take notes of the officer’s badge number, agency, and full name, as well as the 
details of everything that happens.
If you are asked to stop recording, it is advisable that you comply to limit escalating the situation. Instead, you can take mental
notes and write them down immediately after the encounter.
If you are detained and have U.S. citizen children who are minors, consider telling the officers this detail, as it could impact 
whether or not they choose to detain you. However, if your children are undocumented, you may not want to mention them in case ICE 
decides to detain them as well.

Your Rights Outside of Your Home
In any interaction with law or immigration enforcement, the most important practices to remember are:

Stay calm
Stay silent (don’t mention where you were born or how you entered the US)
Record details and names
Do NOT run away
Ask to speak to your lawyer before signing any documents or answering any questions
Encountering immigration officers outside of your home can come with additional pressures and constraints. Make sure that you are 
familiar with your rights, and practice responding to requests so that if you are ever in a position where you are being questioned,
you can remain calm and respond appropriately.

ICE is only allowed to arrest you in a public place, like a park or the street, if they have a warrant with your name on it. 
Otherwise, to detain you, they need evidence that you are a non-citizen. Remember to stay calm and not to run.
If you are stopped, ask the officer: “Am I being arrested or detained?” If the officer says no, then ask “Am I free to leave?” If 
they say yes, calmly walk away. If they arrest you, ask to call your lawyer. Remember: you have the right to remain silent and 
refuse a search. You do not have to sign any documents without your lawyer present

If immigration enforcement attempts to enter your workplace to conduct a raid or detain individuals, remember the basic rights above. 
Make sure you make a plan with your coworkers that you trust ahead of time where everyone agrees to stay calm, not to run, and to 
stay silent.
Keep in mind that employers don’t have to let anybody enter their building without a search or arrest warrant. This may be a good 
topic to address ahead of time with your employer so that they understand their own rights and can better protect their employees.

If you are stopped while driving, show the police your driver’s license (if you do not have a valid license, you should NOT be 
driving). If they ask, show your car registration and proof of insurance. Other than that, you don’t have to say anything else. If 
an officer or immigration agent asks to look inside your car, you can tell them that you refuse to consent to the search. But if 
police believe your car contains evidence of a crime, your car can be searched without your consent.

It is illegal for law enforcement officers to perform any stops, searches, detentions, or removals based solely on your religion, 
race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
However, law enforcement officers at the airport and at the border generally have the authority to search all bags and to ask you 
questions about your citizenship and travel itinerary, though if you are simply flying domestically (between U.S. cities or states)
it is unusual for officers to ask questions about citizenship status. If you are taken into custody at the airport, you should 
request to speak with an attorney, not sign any papers, and remain silent.
It is important that you only attempt to fly if you have a valid (unexpired) state or federal ID. Some forms of ID that are 
accepted by TSA are: state-issued driver’s license, state ID, passport from your country of origin, or a DACA EAD card.

Stay calm and do not run away
Remain silent, or tell the ICE agent that you want to remain silent. If you do speak, do not lie.
Ask to speak with a lawyer
Do NOT sign any documents or answer questions without your lawyer present
Record details and names of officers
